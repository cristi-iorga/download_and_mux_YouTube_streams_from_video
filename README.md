Also, check if you have ffmpeg installed on your machine (https://www.ffmpeg.org/). It is required for the process of muxing a video and an audio stream together.

This script takes the link to a YouTube video that you input and displays all the available streams. You can choose to download a specific video and a specific audio stream and have the programm automatically mux them together. You can also download only an audio stream if you so desire.
